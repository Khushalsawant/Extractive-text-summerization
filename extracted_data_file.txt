An exchangetraded fund ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges much like stocks An ETF holds assets such as stocks commodities or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value although deviations can occasionally occur Most ETFs track an index such as a stock index or bond index ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs tax efficiency and stocklike features
ETF distributors only buy or sell ETFs directly from or to authorized participants which are large brokerdealers with whom they have entered into agreementsand then only in creation units which are large blocks of tens of thousands of ETF shares usually exchanged inkind with baskets of the underlying securities Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long term but they usually act as market makers on the open market using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide liquidity of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the net asset value of the underlying assets Other investors such as individuals using a retail broker trade ETF shares on this secondary market
An ETF combines the valuation feature of a mutual fund or unit investment trust which can be bought or sold at the end of each trading day for its net asset value with the tradability feature of a closedend fund which trades throughout the trading day at prices that may be more or less than its net asset value Closedend funds are not considered to be ETFs even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange ETFs have been available in the US since  and in Europe since  ETFs traditionally have been index funds but in  the US Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs
ETFs offer both tax efficiency as well as lower transaction and management costs More than US trillion were invested in ETFs in the United States between when they were introduced in  and  By the end of  ETFs offered  different products covering almost every conceivable market sector niche and trading strategy
An ETF is a type of fund It owns assets bonds stocks gold bars etc and divides ownership of itself into shares that are held by shareholders The details of the structure such as a corporation or trust will vary by country and even within one country there may be multiple possible structures The shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund and they will typically get an annual report Shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits such as interest or dividends and they may get a residual value in case the fund is liquidated Their ownership interest in the fund can easily be bought and sold
ETFs are similar in many ways to traditional mutual funds except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks on a stock exchange through a brokerdealer Unlike traditional mutual funds ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value NAV Instead financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF but only in large blocks such as  shares called creation units Purchases and redemptions of the creation units generally are in kind with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for some or all of the securities in the basket of assets
The ability to purchase and redeem creation units gives ETFs an arbitrage mechanism intended to minimize the potential deviation between the market price and the net asset value of ETF shares Existing ETFs have transparent portfolios so institutional investors will know exactly what portfolio assets they must assemble if they wish to purchase a creation unit and the exchange disseminates the updated net asset value of the shares throughout the trading day typically at second intervals
If there is strong investor demand for an ETF its share price will temporarily rise above its net asset value per share giving arbitrageurs an incentive to purchase additional creation units from the ETF and sell the component ETF shares in the open market The additional supply of ETF shares reduces the market price per share generally eliminating the premium over net asset value A similar process applies when there is weak demand for an ETF its shares trade at a discount from net asset value
In the United States most ETFs are structured as openend management investment companies the same structure used by mutual funds and money market funds although a few ETFs including some of the largest ones are structured as unit investment trusts ETFs structured as openend funds have greater flexibility in constructing a portfolio and are not prohibited from participating in securities lending programs or from using futures and options in achieving their investment objectives
Under existing regulations a new ETF must receive an order from the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC giving it relief from provisions of the Investment Company Act of  that would not otherwise allow the ETF structure In  the SEC proposed rules that would allow the creation of ETFs without the need for
exemptive orders Under the SEC proposal an ETF would be defined as a registered openend management investment company that
The SEC rule proposal would allow ETFs either to be index funds or to be fully transparent actively managed funds Historically all ETFs in the United States had been index fundscitation needed In  however the SEC began issuing exemptive orders to fully transparent actively managed ETFs The first such order was to PowerShares Actively Managed ExchangeTraded Fund Trust and the first actively managed ETF in the United States was the Bear Stearns Current Yield Fund a shortterm income fund that began trading on the American Stock Exchange under the
symbol YYY on March   The SEC rule proposal indicates that the SEC may still consider future applications for exemptive orders for actively managed ETFs that do not satisfy the proposed rules transparency requirements
Some ETFs invest primarily in commodities or commoditybased instruments such as crude oil and precious metals Although these commodity ETFs are similar in practice to ETFs that invest in securities they are not investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 
Publicly traded grantor trusts such as Merrill Lynchs HOLDRs securities are sometimes considered to be ETFs although they lack many of the characteristics of other ETFs Investors in a grantor trust have a direct interest in the underlying basket of securities which does not change except to reflect corporate actions such as stock splits and mergers Funds of this type are not investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 
As of  there were approximately  exchangetraded funds traded on US exchanges This count uses the wider definition of ETF including HOLDRs and closedend funds
ETFs had their genesis in  with Index Participation Shares an SP  proxy that traded on the American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange This product however was shortlived after a lawsuit by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was successful in stopping sales in the United States
A similar product Toronto Index Participation Shares started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSE in  The shares which tracked the TSE  and later the TSE  indices proved to be popular The popularity of these products led the American Stock Exchange to try to develop something that would satisfy SEC regulation in the United States
Nathan Most and Steven Bloom under the direction of Ivers Riley designed and developed Standard  Poors Depositary Receipts NYSE Arca SPY which were introduced in January  Known as SPDRs or Spiders the fund became the largest ETF in the world In May  they introduced the MidCap SPDRs NYSE Arca MDY
Barclays Global Investors a subsidiary of Barclays PLC in conjunction with MSCI and as its underwriter a Bostonbased third party distributor Funds Distributor Inc entered the market in  with World Equity Benchmark Shares WEBS which became iShares MSCI Index Fund Shares WEBS tracked MSCI country indices originally  of the funds index provider Morgan Stanley WEBS were particularly innovative because they gave casual investors easy access to foreign markets While SPDRs were organized as unit investment trusts WEBS were set up as a mutual fund the first of their kind
In  State Street Global Advisors introduced Sector Spiders which follow nine sectors of the SP  Also in  the Dow Diamonds NYSE Arca DIA were introduced tracking the famous Dow Jones Industrial Average In  the influential cubes NASDAQ QQQ were launched attempting to replicate the movement of the NASDAQ
In  Barclays Global Investors put a significant effort behind the ETF marketplace with a strong emphasis on education and distribution to reach longterm investors The iShares line was launched in early  Within five years iShares had surpassed the assets of any other ETF competitor in the US and Europe Barclays Global Investors was sold to BlackRock in 
The Vanguard Group entered the market in  The first fund was Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF NYSE Arca VTI which has become quite popular and they made the Vanguard Extended Market Index ETF NYSE Arca VXF Some of Vanguards ETFs are a share class of an existing mutual fund
iShares made the first bond funds in July  based on US Treasury bonds and corporate bonds such as iShares iBoxx  Invst Grade Crp Bond NYSE Arca LQD They also created a TIPS fund In  they introduced funds based on junk and muni bonds about the same time State Street and Vanguard created several of their own bond ETFs
Since then ETFs have proliferated tailored to an increasingly specific array of regions sectors commodities bonds futures and other asset classes As of January  there were over  ETFs traded in the US with over  trillion in assets In December  US ETF assets went above  trillion
ETFs generally provide the easy diversification low expense ratios and tax efficiency of index funds while still maintaining all the features of ordinary stock such as limit orders short selling and options Because ETFs can be economically acquired held and disposed of some investors invest in ETF shares as a longterm investment for asset allocation purposes while other investors trade ETF shares frequently to hedge risk over short periods or implement market timing investment strategies Among the advantages of ETFs are the following
Some of these advantages derive from the status of most ETFs as index funds
Most ETFs are index funds that attempt to replicate the performance of a specific index Indexes may be based on stocks bonds commodities or currencies An index fund seeks to track the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in the index As of June  in the United States about  index ETFs exist with about  actively managed ETFs Index ETF assets are about  trillion compared with about  billion for actively managed ETFs Some index ETFs known as leveraged ETFs or inverse ETFs use investments in derivatives to seek a return that corresponds to a multiple of or the inverse opposite of the daily performance of the index
Some index ETFs invest  of their assets proportionately in the securities underlying an index a manner of investing called replication Other index ETFs use representative sampling investing  to  of their assets in the securities of an underlying index and investing the remaining  to  of their assets in other holdings such as futures option and swap contracts and securities not in the underlying index that the funds adviser believes will help the ETF to achieve its investment objective There are various ways the ETF can be weighted such as equal weighting or revenue weighting For index ETFs that invest in indices with thousands of underlying securities some index ETFs employ aggressive sampling and invest in only a tiny percentage of the underlying securities
The first and most popular ETFs track stocks Many funds track national indexes for example Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF NYSE Arca VTI tracks the CRSP US Total Market Index and several funds track the SP  both indexes for US stocks Other funds own stocks from many countries for example Vanguard Total International Stock Index NYSE Arca VXUS tracks the MSCI All Country World ex USA Investable Market Index while the iShares MSCI EAFE Index NYSE Arca EFA tracks the MSCI EAFE Index both world exUS indexes
Stock ETFs can have different styles such as largecap smallcap growth value et cetera For example the SP  index is large and midcap so the SPDR SP  ETF will not contain smallcap stocks Others such as iShares Russell  are mainly for smallcap stocks There are many style ETFs such as iShares Russell  Growth and iShares Russell  Value ETFs focusing on dividends have been popular in the first few years of the s decade such as iShares Select Dividend
ETFs can also be sector funds These can be broad sectors like finance and technology or specific niche areas like green power They can also be for one country or global Critics have said that no one needs a sector fund This point is not really specific to ETFs the issues are the same as with mutual funds The funds are popular since people can put their money into the latest fashionable trend rather than investing in boring areas with no cachet
Exchangetraded funds that invest in bonds are known as bond ETFs They thrive during economic recessions because investors pull their money out of the stock market and into bonds for example government treasury bonds or those issued by companies regarded as financially stable Because of this cause and effect relationship the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative of broader economic conditions There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party
Commodity ETFs CETFs or ETCs invest in commodities such as precious metals agricultural products or hydrocarbons Among the first commodity ETFs were gold exchangetraded funds which have been offered in a number of countries The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India when they filed a proposal with the SEBI in May  The first gold exchangetraded fund was Gold Bullion Securities launched on the ASX in  and the first silver exchangetraded fund was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in  As of November  a commodity ETF namely SPDR Gold Shares was the secondlargest ETF by market capitalization
However generally commodity ETFs are index funds tracking nonsecurity indices Because they do not invest in securities commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of  in the United States although their public offering is subject to SEC review and they need an SEC noaction letter under the Securities Exchange Act of  They may however be subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
The earliest commodity ETFs such as SPDR Gold Shares NYSE Arca GLD and iShares Silver Trust NYSE Arca SLV owned the physical commodity eg gold and silver bars Similar to these are ETFS Physical Palladium NYSE Arca PALL and ETFS Physical Platinum NYSE Arca PPLT However most ETCs implement a futures trading strategy which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity
Commodity ETFs trade just like shares are simple and efficient and provide exposure to an everincreasing range of commodities and commodity indices including energy metals softs and agriculture However it is important for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent For example buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might think that as long as oil goes up they will profit roughly linearly What isnt clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities In the case of many commodity funds they simply roll socalled frontmonth futures contracts from month to month This does give exposure to the commodity but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure such as a high cost to roll
ETC can also refer to exchangetraded notes which are not exchangetraded funds
In  Rydex Investments launched the first currency ETF called the Euro Currency Trust NYSE Arca FXE in New York Since then Rydex has launched a series of funds tracking all major currencies under their brand CurrencyShares In  Deutsche Banks db xtrackers launched EONIA Total Return Index ETF in Frankfurt tracking the euro and later in  the Sterling Money Market ETF LSE XGBP and US Dollar Money Market ETF LSE XUSD in London In  ETF Securities launched the worlds largest FX platform tracking the MSFXSM Index covering  long or short USD ETC vs single G currencies The funds are total return products where the investor gets access to the FX spot change local institutional interest rates and a collateral yield
Most ETFs are index funds but some ETFs do have active management Actively managed ETFs have been offered in the United States only since  The first active ETF was Bear Stearns Current Yield ETF Ticker YYY Currently actively managed ETFs are fully transparent publishing their current securities portfolios on their web sites daily However the SEC indicated that it was willing to consider allowing actively managed ETFs that are not fully transparent in the future and later actively managed ETFs have sought alternatives to full transparency
The fully transparent nature of existing ETFs means that an actively managed ETF is at risk from arbitrage activities by market participants who might choose to front run its trades as daily reports of the ETFs holdings reveals its managers trading strategy The initial actively managed equity ETFs addressed this problem by trading only weekly or monthly Actively managed debt ETFs which are less susceptible to frontrunning trade their holdings more frequently
The actively managed ETF market has largely been seen as more favorable to bond funds because concerns about disclosing bond holdings are less pronounced there are fewer product choices and there is increased appetite for bond products Pimcos Enhanced Short Duration ETF NYSE MINT is the largest actively managed ETF with approximately  billion in assets as of May  
Actively managed ETFs grew faster in their first three years of existence than index ETFs did in their first three years of existence As track records develop many see actively managed ETFs as a significant competitive threat to actively managed mutual funds However many academic studies have questioned the value of active management Jack Bogle of Vanguard Group wrote an article in the Financial Analysts Journal where he estimated that higher fees as well as hidden costs such a more trading fees and lower return from holding cash reduce returns for investors by around  percentage points a year a huge differential considering that longterm real returns from American equities have been  Even without considering hidden costs high fees negatively affect longterm performance In another Financial Analysts Journal article Nobel laureate Bill Sharpe calculated that someone who saved via a lowcost fund would have a standard of living in retirement  higher than someone who saved in a highcost fund
An exchangetraded grantor trust was used to give a direct interest in a static basket of stocks selected from a particular industry Such products have some properties in common with ETFslow costs low turnover and tax efficiencybut are generally regarded as separate from ETFs The leading example was Holding Company Depositary Receipts or HOLDRs a proprietary Merrill Lynch product but these have now disappeared from the scene SPDR Gold Shares is a grantor trust
Inverse ETFs are constructed by using various derivatives for the purpose of profiting from a decline in the value of the underlying benchmark It is a similar type of investment to holding several short positions or using a combination of advanced investment strategies to profit from falling prices Many inverse ETFs use daily futures as their underlying benchmark
Leveraged exchangetraded funds LETFs or leveraged ETFs are a type of ETF that attempt to achieve returns that are more sensitive to market movements than nonleveraged ETFs Leveraged index ETFs are often marketed as bull or bear funds A leveraged bull ETF fund might for example attempt to achieve daily returns that are x or x more pronounced than the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the SP  A leveraged inverse bear ETF fund on the other hand may attempt to achieve returns that are x or x the daily index return meaning that it will gain double or triple the loss of the market Leveraged ETFs require the use of financial engineering techniques including the use of equity swaps derivatives and rebalancing and reindexing to achieve the desired return The most common way to construct leveraged ETFs is by trading futures contracts
The rebalancing and reindexing of leveraged ETFs may have considerable costs when markets are volatile The rebalancing problem is that the fund manager incurs trading losses because he needs to buy when the index goes up and sell when the index goes down in order to maintain a fixed leverage ratio A  daily change in the index will for example reduce value of a x bear fund by about  per day which means that about a third of the fund may be wasted in trading losses within a year  Investors may however circumvent this problem by buying or writing futures directly accepting a varying leverage ratiocitation needed A more reasonable estimate of daily market changes is  which leads to a  yearly loss of principal in a x leveraged fund
The reindexing problem of leveraged ETFs stems from the arithmetic effect of volatility of the underlying index Take for example an index that begins at  and a X fund based on that index that also starts at  In a first trading period for example a day the index rises  to  The X fund will then rise  to  The index then drops back to  a drop of  so that it is now even The drop in the X fund will be   But  of  is  This puts the value of the X fund at  Even though the index is unchanged after two trading periods an investor in the X fund would have lost  This decline in value can be even greater for inverse funds leveraged funds with negative multipliers such as   or  It always occurs when the change in value of the underlying index changes direction And the decay in value increases with volatility of the underlying index
The effect of leverage is also reflected in the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs In particular the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF EuropeanAmerican put or call depends on the realized variance hence the path of the underlying index The impact of leverage ratio can also be observed from the implied volatility surfaces of leveraged ETF options For instance the implied volatility curves of inverse leveraged ETFs with negative multipliers such as   or  are commonly observed to be increasing in strike which is characteristically different from the implied volatility smiles or skews seen for index options or nonleveraged ETF options
The SEC in May  granted approval of a pair of x leveraged ETF related to SP  Futures before rescinding the approval a few weeks later  The decision concerns two potential products ForceShares Daily X US Market Futures Long Fund which would have listed under the ticker UP and ForceShares Daily X US Market Futures Short Fund with the ticker DOWN
ETFs have a reputation for lower costs than traditional mutual funds This will be evident as a lower expense ratio This is mainly from two factors the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure However this needs to be compared in each case since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio and some ETFs expense ratios are relatively high An index fund is much simpler to run since it does not require some security selection and can be largely done by computer Not only does an ETF have lower shareholderrelated expenses but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses Mutual funds can charge  to  or more index fund expense ratios are generally lower while ETFs are almost always less than  Over the long term these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference
Because ETFs trade on an exchange each transaction is generally subject to a brokerage commission Commissions depend on the brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer For example a typical flat fee schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from  to  but it can be as low as  with discount brokers Because of this commission cost the amount invested has a great bearing someone who wishes to invest  per month may lose a significant percentage of their investment immediately while for someone making a  investment the commission cost may be negligible Generally mutual funds obtained directly from the fund company itself do not charge a brokerage fee Thus when low or nocost transactions are available ETFs become very competitive
The cost difference is more evident when compared with mutual funds that charge a frontend or backend load as ETFs do not have loads at all The redemption fee and shortterm trading fees are examples of other fees associated with mutual funds that do not exist with ETFs Traders should be cautious if they plan to trade inverse and leveraged ETFs for short periods of time Close attention should be paid to transaction costs and daily performance rates as the potential combined compound loss can sometimes go unrecognized and offset potential gains over a longer period of time
ETFs are structured for tax efficiency and can be more attractive than mutual funds In the US whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions These gains are taxable to all shareholders even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund In contrast ETFs are not redeemed by holders instead holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market as they would a stock or effect a nontaxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares for a gain
In most cases an ETFs are more tax efficient than a mutual funds in the same asset classes or categories An exception is ETFs offered by Vanguard which are simply a different share class of their mutual funds In some cases this means Vanguard ETFs do not enjoy the same tax advantages In other cases Vanguard uses the ETF structure to let the entire fund defer capital gains benefiting both the ETF holders and mutual fund holders In addition Vanguard can use the mutual fund structure get an additional advantage from tax loss harvesting any capital losses from net redemptions
In the UK ETFs can be shielded from capital gains tax by placing them in an Individual Savings Account ISA or SelfInvested Personal Pension SIPP in the same manner as many other shares Because UKresident ETFs would be liable for UK corporation tax on nonUK dividends most ETFs which hold nonUK companies sold to UK investors are issued in Ireland or Luxembourg
An important benefit of an ETF is the stocklike features offered A mutual fund is bought or sold at the end of a days trading whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open Since ETFs trade on the market investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock For instance investors can sell short use a limit order use a stoploss order buy on margin and invest as much or as little money as they wish there is no minimum investment requirement Also many ETFs have the capability for options puts and calls to be written against them Covered call strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums the proceeds of a call sale or write on calls written against them Mutual funds do not offer those features
New regulations were put in place following the  Flash Crash when prices of ETFs and other stocks and options became volatile with trading markets spiking and bids falling as low as a penny a share in what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC investigation described as one of the most turbulent periods in the history of financial markets
These regulations proved to be inadequate to protect investors in the August   flash crash when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value ETFs were consequently put under even greater scrutiny by regulators and investors Analysts at Morningstar claimed in December  that ETFs are a digitalage technology governed by Depressionera legislation
The ETF tracking error is the difference between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset A nonzero tracking error therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference It is different than the premiumdiscount which is the difference between the ETFs NAV updated only once a day and its market price Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid allowing for full replication In contrast some ETFs such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure or the reference asset or index is illiquid Futuresbased ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields as seen in the VIX futures market
ETFs that buy and hold commodities or futures of commodities have become popular For example SPDR Gold Shares ETF GLD has  million ounces in trust The silver ETF SLV is also very large The commodity ETFs are in effect consumers of their target commodities thereby affecting the price in a spurious fashion In the words of the IMF Some market participants believe the growing popularity of exchangetraded funds ETFs may have contributed to equity price appreciation in some emerging economies and warn that leverage embedded in ETFs could pose financial stability risks if equity prices were to decline for a protracted period
Synthetic ETFs are attracting regulatory attention from the FSB the IMF and the BIS Areas of concern include the lack of transparency in products and increasing complexity conflicts of interest and lack of regulatory compliance
A synthetic ETF has counterparty risk because the counterparty is contractually obligated to match the return on the index The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty A potential hazard is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral and that collateral could be of dubious quality Furthermore the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty These types of setups are not allowed under the European guidelines Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities UCITS so the investor should look for UCITS IIIcompliant funds
ETFs have a wide range of liquidity Some funds are constantly traded with tens of millions of shares per day changing hands while others trade only once in a while even not trading for some days There are many funds that do not trade very often This just means that most trading is conducted in the most popular funds The most active funds such as SPY IWM QQQ et cetera are very liquid with high volume and tight spreads In these cases the investor is almost sure to get a reasonable price even in difficult conditions With other funds it is worthwhile to take some care in execution This does not mean that less popular funds are not a quality investment This is in contrast with traditional mutual funds where everyone who trades on the same day gets the same price
John C Bogle founder of the Vanguard Group a leading issuer of index mutual funds and since Bogles retirement of ETFs has argued that ETFs represent shortterm speculation that their trading expenses decrease returns to investors and that most ETFs provide insufficient diversification He concedes that a broadly diversified ETF that is held over time can be a good investment
ETFs are dependent on the efficacy of the arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net asset value While the average deviation between the daily closing price and the daily NAV of ETFs that track domestic indices is generally less than  the deviations may be more significant for ETFs that track certain foreign indices The Wall Street Journal reported in November  during a period of market turbulence that some lightly traded ETFs frequently had deviations of  or more exceeding  in a handful of cases although even for these niche ETFs the average deviation was only a little more than  The trades with the greatest deviations tended to be made immediately after the market opened
According to a study on ETF returns in  by Morgan Stanley ETFs missed in  their targets by an average of  percentage points a gap more than twice as wide as the percentagepoint average they posted in  Part of this socalled tracking error is attributed to the proliferation of ETFs targeting exotic investments or areas where trading is less frequent such as emergingmarket stocks futurecontracts based commodity indices and junk bondscitation needed
The tax advantages of ETFs are of no relevance for investors using taxdeferred accounts or indeed investors who are taxexempt in the first place However the lower expense ratios are proving difficult for the proponents of traditional mutual funds to overcome
In a survey of investment professionals the most frequently cited disadvantage of ETFs was the unknown untested indices used by many ETFs followed by the overwhelming number of choices
Some critics claim that ETFs can be and have been used to manipulate market prices including having been used for short selling that has been asserted by some observers to have contributed to the market collapse of
